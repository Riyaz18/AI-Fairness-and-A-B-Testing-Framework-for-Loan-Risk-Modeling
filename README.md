# AI-Fairness-and-A-B-Testing-Framework-for-Loan-Risk-Modeling
This project implements an A/B test simulation to compare a **Standard Loan Approval Model (A)** against a **Bias-Mitigated Model (B)**. The core focus is on quantifying model performance (Accuracy, F1 Score) and algorithmic fairness using the **Disparate Impact** metric.
